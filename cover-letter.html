			Dear Max Mustermann!
		</p>
		<p>
			"Use tech for good" - That is one of four values at my school.
			After I saw the job posting on Glassdoor and read about your company,
			I got excited to apply for the Software Engineer Internship.
			I want to gain work experience without disregarding my values.
			Contributing to the research and development of the healthcare industry
			at Company Full Name would be a great opportunity for me
			to combine these preconditions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since 2021 I have been part of a nontraditional,
			progressive and innovative study approach.<br />
			The <img class="img42" src="images/42.svg" alt="42" />
			curriculum is a peer-to-peer driven study program
		       	consisting of hands-on projects covering many different aspects
			of software development with emphasize on C and C++ programming.
			In the peer-to-peer environment I learned to give and receive feedback,
			and build upon it.
	 		With only deadlines providing me a framework, I found learning itself to be
			my driving factor and keeping me motivated. The loose structure also
			forced me to self-organize and enhanced my ability to read into
			and learn from documentation directly.<br />
			My C++ journey began after having learned C for one year.
			On my resume I showcase my most impactful projects
			(two of them being written in C++), giving a brief overview
			of the assignment and summarizing my work.
			All my school projects can be found on my github profile.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the last year I shifted my focus towards personal goals
			and adding more tools to my knowledge base.<br />
			I discovered Assembly, which gave me insights into
			hardware related topics and broadened my understanding
			of software on a low level.
			I picked up touch typing and VIM and rediscovered Make,
			to increase efficiency and improve my adaptability to work
			in different environments.
			Recently I started learning HTML and CSS
			and applied my freshly acquired knowledge to compose
			this cover letter and my resume from the ground up.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am excited to continue my C++ journey and keep on
			extending my knowledge. I look forward to share more experiences
			and get to know more about Company Full Name.
			Thank you for your time and consideration.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sincerely,<br />
			Nils Ostermeier
